# bullswarm changelog

## 0.5.0 — gap-closure release

Workflow parity with Claude Code dynamic workflows plus deep-QA hardening.
All 10 gaps identified in the v0.4.0 audit are closed; 23 new tests
added; full suite is 105 green (82 prior + 23 new).

### Workflow runtime (R-numbered doctrine)

- **R4 — global concurrency limiter**: a real `Semaphore` (`src/workflow/semaphore.js`) is shared by every `runSingle` and every fanout worker. Per-fanout worker count is capped at `min(per-fanout, limiter.permits, items.length)`. A `step.blocked` event fires when items queue behind the cap.
- **R6 — recursion-guard propagation**: every workflow dispatch computes `childDepthEnv(parentEnv)` and passes it to `watchOnce`. The runtime asserts `assertDepthAllowed(coreState, parentEnv)` before each dispatch. A workflow that itself spawns `bullswarm` is refused at the core's depth limit instead of recursing forever. `src/lib/watch.js` now honors caller-supplied `opts.env` so the depth env actually reaches the child.
- **R7 — quarantine + decision log on workflow auth failures**: when a dispatch inside a workflow returns `quarantineHint: true`, the runtime calls `quarantinePool(state, poolName, why, now)` against the core state file and appends a `source: "workflow"` entry to the shared `decisionLog` so `bullswarm health` and `pools` see workflow runs. The live `pools` view is updated so the next dispatch in the same run does not re-select the benched pool.
- **R8 — burst-gate exclusion in workflows**: `preparePools` now drops any pool with `burstGate === true` (5h ≥ 90 %), matching the single-run path.
- **R10 — fingerprint-aligned fanout resume**: every fanout result is now stamped with `sha1(JSON.stringify(item)).slice(0,12)`. On resume, items are matched by fingerprint first; positional alignment is a fallback for state.json from prior versions. Reordering, adding, or removing items no longer breaks resume.
- **R9 — outputText truncation**: `recordOutput` caps `state.outputs[id].outputText` at `OUTPUT_TEXT_CAP_BYTES = 64 KB`. The on-disk outFile always holds the full transcript. Persisted state.json is now bounded.

### New step type: `verify` (skeptic)

- Adversarial review of a prior step. Schema: `{ type: "verify", review: "outputs.<prior>.outFile", lane, prompt?, timeoutSec? }`. The runtime reads the prior outFile, inlines it into a structured prompt asking for `RETURN ONLY {"ok": <bool>, "concerns": [...], "summary": ...}`, dispatches through the standard pool-routed pipeline, and parses the first JSON object in the response. Step is `ok:true` only if dispatch verifies AND the JSON `ok` is `true`. The parsed `verify` object is recorded on `state.outputs[id].verify` so downstream steps can reference `concerns` and `summary`.
- Validated: `review` must resolve to a known prior outFile or a declared input; `inputs.<k>.required` is now type-checked and runtime-enforced.
- See `workflows/verify-and-cap.json` for an end-to-end example.

### New settings

- `settings.maxAgents` — hard cap; a step that would push dispatch count past the cap fails with `why: "spend guard: maxAgents=... reached"`.
- `settings.warnAtAgents` — advisory; a `workflow.large` event fires once when the threshold is crossed. TUI renders it as `⚠ Large workflow: N dispatches ≥ threshold M`.
- `settings.concurrency` is now validated to be `≤ 16`, matching Claude Code's runtime cap.
- `inputs.<k>.required: true` is now a hard pre-flight refusal. `runWorkflow` throws `required input "<k>" missing` before any dispatch.

### New runtime events

- `item.skipped` — emitted by fanout resume; was dropped silently in TTY mode. Now rendered as `⏭ <stepId>[i]   ok from previous run (resume)`.
- `step.blocked` — emitted when items queue behind the global cap; rendered as `⋈ N item(s) queued behind concurrency cap in <stepId>`.
- `workflow.large` — emitted once when the dispatch threshold is crossed.

### CLI

- `BULLSWARM_HOME` env var now overrides the workflow CLI's `BULLSWARM_DIR` (previously hardcoded to `~/.bullswarm`). Matches the meter registry.
- `--input k=v` accepts JSON-encoded values so arrays and objects can be passed: `--input 'items=["a","b"]'`. The legacy string form is unchanged.

### TUI

- `item.skipped`, `step.blocked`, and `workflow.large` are all rendered in human mode (previously `item.skipped` was TTY-invisible).

### Tests

- 23 new tests in `tests/workflow-gaps.test.js`, one per gap closure.
- 105 total tests, all green, no network, ~1 s.

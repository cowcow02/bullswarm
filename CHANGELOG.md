# bullswarm changelog

## 0.18.3 — mobile timeline polish

- Auto-follow now begins at a timestamped milestone instead of exposing an
  orphaned detail line when a long timeline is clipped on a small terminal.
- Qualified terminal runs state the number of concerns and direct the user to
  review them in the result envelope.

## 0.18.2 — truthful recovery timeline and verifier cleanup

- Dependency-blocked plan branches now appear as a single skipped phase in the
  workflow timeline instead of several failed agents followed by a
  contradictory completed phase.
- The Live panel ignores stale terminal agent records, and verifier retry
  cleanup now removes the retrying agent as soon as the bounded retry ends.
- Verifier verdict parsing conservatively repairs an otherwise valid JSON
  object truncated only by missing final closing brackets. Malformed content
  still fails closed, while provider truncation no longer forces an expensive
  planner recovery round.

## 0.18.1 — original-goal verification and denser timeline

- Goal workflows now derive a durable requirement ledger from the original
  user goal. Planner verify actions declare which requirements they cover, and
  neither explicit nor program-level completion is accepted until every
  requirement has a successful verifier with specific evidence. The verifier
  receives the original goal from the runtime, so a reduced planner scope can
  no longer silently omit requested APIs, events, tests, or documentation.
- Successful verifier concerns are preserved in a verified
  `completed_with_concerns` result instead of being discarded or triggering
  unnecessary follow-up spending.
- The human timeline calls its first accepted planner decision `plan created`,
  later decisions `plan updated`, and the final one `completion confirmed`.
  Execution milestones are rendered as one dense block without blank rows.
  Finished workflows now say `No agents running · workflow finished` and
  `Workflow finished · result ready` instead of control-plane terminology.

## 0.18.0 — exact routes, cheaper plans, clearer results

- `workflow goal` can now guarantee an exact planner model and a separate exact
  worker route with `--orchestrator-model`, `--worker-pool`, and
  `--worker-model`. The worker lock is runtime-owned and propagates through the
  scout, ordinary actions, fan-out items, verification repairs, reverification,
  and extraction helpers; unsupported or excluded models fail closed instead
  of silently substituting another model.
- An action-bearing planner `proceed` is normalized to the schema-equivalent
  `needs_more_work` program before validation. This removes a redundant
  correction turn without changing the proposed graph or weakening any safety
  check (the prior real run spent four frontier planner turns correcting this
  exact representation mismatch).
- `workflow runs result` now selects the latest successful verifier that
  transitively covers the delivery, so a final suite verifier depending on
  unit verifiers is surfaced ahead of a narrower direct unit check.
- The same result envelope now adds a backward-compatible `deliveries[]`
  frontier for parallel multi-worker outcomes while preserving the singular
  `delivery` field for existing callers.
- The autonomous planner now batches cheap homogeneous edits instead of paying
  for a worker and unit verifier per tiny file; substantial independent units
  still fan out and retain focused verification before the final suite.
- Narrow SSH and phone terminals now open on a full-width workflow timeline;
  `t` toggles between that overview and the phase browser without affecting the
  existing Enter/Esc agent drill-down.
- Goal-level `--orchestrator <pool>` is now a preference with immediate
  fallback when that pool is quota-gated, ineligible, or unavailable. Exact
  provider testing moves to `--strict-orchestrator <pool>`. Quota waits now
  refresh the durable runner heartbeat at least every 30 seconds, preventing a
  live waiting run from being falsely reconciled as interrupted and making
  cooperative cancellation responsive during long meter-poll intervals.

- The runtime now owns the acceptance bar for every verify and re-verify. Each
  verifier's instructions end with a fixed "Acceptance standard (runtime-owned;
  it overrides any stricter rule in the instructions above)": `ok:false` means
  the work is unusable — its acceptance command fails, a required deliverable
  is missing, or the answer is nonsense — and everything else (style, scope,
  cosmetic mismatches, process rules the goal never stated such as append-only,
  files changed by other actions in the shared tree) goes in `concerns` under
  `ok:true`. A re-verify rejects only when the work is still unusable or the
  repair broke the acceptance checks. Direction from the user after `8ebi8a`:
  "unless it is completely nonsense or unable to finish I don't see a reason to
  reject so easily".
- Repair prompts carry a runtime-owned shared-tree rule: edit only the files
  the reviewed work owns; a concern about other files is not the repair's to
  resolve; never revert, checkout or delete other actions' changes. Earned on
  `8ebi8a`: `verify-docs` rejected on a repo-wide `git diff --stat` scope check
  while siblings were writing, and its repair reverted five `src/` files it did
  not own to satisfy the concern.
- Planner contract: rule 2 requires exactly one owner per file, including any
  existing test the change breaks (the `workflow-adaptive.test.js:206` gap for
  the fourth time); rule 7 restates the lenient bar above; the validator line
  now says ids are unique across the whole run, finished and failed actions
  included (turn 2 of `8ebi8a` re-proposed the blocked id `verify-suite` and
  spent a 97 s correction turn on it).
- Goal-4 rerun on `7724da1` (`8ebi8a`, rule 7 + PR #5): 42 min 03 s, three
  planner turns (775 s, 31 %), parallelism 1.34, 23 dispatches (20 on
  `kaihk/gpt-5.6-luna`), three repair rounds each rejected on re-verify for
  reasons the prompts caused, tail of five actions blocked, recovery program
  auto-completed, 315/315, existing tests +179/−1. Goal-4 line:
  44 → 72 → 37 → 25 → 36 → 42 min.

## 0.17.0 — the timeline tells the execution story

- Workflow timeline (PR #5) hardened after a 16-agent adversarial review against
  real run state (23 findings, 21 confirmed): worker rows now name their phase
  (`├─✓ [Verify] verify-impl`) because concurrent phases interleave in time
  order and the tree glyph alone hung a row under the wrong phase; a phase whose
  actions never started (a blocked tail) is shown as `[Phase: X] blocked`
  instead of vanishing; the header line is truncated so widths down to 20
  columns really hold; PgUp now scrolls the timeline to earlier rows (it was a
  dead key at the newest view) and scroll state resets when the pane changes;
  below 100 columns the footer and status line no longer advertise a timeline
  the narrow layout does not render. Confirmed minors left open are listed on
  PR #5.
- Reworked the autonomous workflow TUI around a human-readable execution story:
  the existing Workflow Planner and phase sidebar now sits beside a timestamped
  timeline of completed preflight, planner, phase, and worker milestones; active
  workers and the waiting/running planner are isolated in a Live section with
  their latest normalized action and stream heartbeat, and future work stays in
  a distinct Next section. `v` keeps raw action-ledger and event evidence one key
  away without mixing it into the default view.
- Rule 7: a verify checks the goal's own acceptance criteria and never adds a
  process rule the goal does not state (append-only, existing tests
  untouched); when the implementation changes what an existing assertion
  pins, a worker must own updating it. Earned three times on goal 4 (attempt
  3, `r2vu9i`, `euh622`): the planner wrote "EXTEND BY APPENDING only" into
  the test worker and its verify while the goal said "do NOT modify existing
  tests except to extend them" and item 5 forced `programFeatures` to grow,
  so the assertion at `workflow-adaptive.test.js:206` had no owner, the
  re-verify rejected the mandated extension, and a planner turn recovered.
- Goal-4 rerun on v0.16.0 (`euh622`): 36 min 00 s, four stage phases in the TUI
  (implement, tests, verify, report) instead of sixteen one-action rows, 22/24
  dispatches on `kaihk/gpt-5.6-luna`, auto-completed, 319/319; two planner
  turns because of the false rejection above (planner turn 2: "an append-only
  rule that the goal itself makes unsatisfiable").

## 0.16.0 — the planner sets the width; a re-verify judges the repair

- A re-verify after a repair round now receives the concerns it raised and the
  repair's report, and may return ok:false only for an unresolved listed
  concern or a regression; anything newly noticed is informational. Earned on
  `r2vu9i`: `verify-src` round 2 rejected on two concerns round 1 never raised;
  `verify-tests-runtime` round 2 rejected the very edit its round 1 demanded.
  Live-proven on `bizp4s`: the one re-verify rejection was an `ENOENT`
  regression in the acceptance checks, and its verdict opens "the two
  original concerns are repaired".
- A phase is a pipeline stage: rule 3 now says one kebab-case name shared by
  its actions, never one phase per action, and the complete-program example
  uses five phases for eight actions (`verify` holds verify-fix, verify-tests
  and verify-suite). Earned on `bizp4s`: the planner mirrored the example and
  wrote sixteen one-action phases — no scheduling cost (phases never gate;
  `dependsOn` does), but a TUI phase list carrying no information.
- Goal-4 rerun on this release (`bizp4s`, runtime `9af8fdf`, workers on
  `kaihk/gpt-5.6-luna`): **25 min 13 s** (attempt 3: 44 min; 0.15.0: 72 min;
  audited contract alone: 37 min), one planner turn (247 s, 16 % of wall),
  parallelism 1.77, 3 repair rounds each fixing a real defect, 0 schema
  retries, 0 corrections, auto-completed, 319/319, existing tests +174/−0.
- Goal-4 rerun on the audited contract (`r2vu9i`): 36 min 58 s (attempt 3:
  44 min; 0.15.0: 72 min), 5 parallel writers, parallelism 1.55, tests depend
  on the implementation run rather than its verify, 0 schema retries, 0
  corrections, auto-completed, 314/314.
- Planner contract audited against Claude Code's workflow-authoring reference
  (three-lens review + adversarial verification, run on the real goal-4 task
  text) and rewritten within the same caps (rules 3,999 / examples 2,938
  chars). New in substance: a verdict is never data (depend on the run that
  wrote your files, not on its verify); split to the width the tree allows
  (one worker for N independent files is N chains in series); outputSchema
  only where a later action reads the object, never on prose; a repair edits
  files and cannot rewrite the answer under review; workers run their unit's
  focused command, never the full suite; the planner sets `lane` and `effort`
  per action. The complete-program example is now valid JSON and shows tests
  running beside the src verify. `docs/planner-prompt-audit-2026-08-29.md` §6.
- Planner-proposed `lane`/`effort`/`requiresCapabilities` now survive the
  gate defaults (`runner.js` spread order let `lane: build` overwrite every
  proposal); `lane` is validated like `effort`.
- `outputSchema` output reading tolerates a closing markdown fence after the
  trailing JSON object, and the schema instruction says the object is an
  INSTANCE whose keys are the `properties` names (never the schema itself).
  Earned on the goal-4 rerun `ydpjts` (0.15.0): a stray `"type"` key and then
  a `}\n```` tail spent the single schema retry and a 279 s planner turn on
  an otherwise complete report (≈ 11 min).
- Goal-4 rerun recorded in `docs/experiments/2026-08-29-dogfood-bullswarm-builds-bullswarm.md`:
  0 repairs (attempt 3: 6), planner 17 % of wall (39 %), 326/326 — but 72 min
  vs 44 min because every worker landed on the slowest most-behind pool and
  the program ran serially (parallelism 1.05).

## 0.15.0 — extra Claude Code logins as separate pools

- Claude Code extra logins (`~/.claude-<slug>` / `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) become
  their own pools (`claude-code:<slug>`), metered and spawned with
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set. Discovery is dynamic from the filesystem; there
  is no hardcoded extra-profile list. The spawn command for each profile is
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<dir> claude`.

## 0.14.1 — the TUI survives its writer; steering lands or expires truthfully

Proven on a goal-3 re-run (`d7xyg2`): 1 planner turn / 269 s (baseline 0.13.1: 1 / 294 s), planner context 6.2 k chars (from 32.7 k), auto-completed, deliverable verified, zero observation crashes — `docs/experiments/2026-08-29-dogfood-bullswarm-builds-bullswarm.md`.

- Workflow `state.json`/`report.json`/`workflow.json` writes are atomic
  (temp + rename, new `src/workflow/fsjson.js`): a concurrent reader can never
  observe a half-written file. Earned: `workflow tui` crashed with
  "Unterminated string in JSON at position 138968" parsing `state.json`
  mid-write (observed twice, 2026-08-29).
- Observation readers tolerate torn or missing JSON: the TUI keeps painting
  the last good frame of the same run, and a render or key-handler error is
  shown in the message line instead of killing the process and stranding the
  terminal in alt-screen raw mode. Mutating commands (stop, approval) retry
  the read once and then refuse loudly instead of silently dropping the
  operator's command. `runs delete` treats an unreadable `state.json` as
  ongoing (refuses without `--force`) rather than deleting a possibly-live run.
- An action being re-run (repair round, re-verify, schema retry) reads as
  `running` and its phase as `active` even when its previous round recorded
  `ok:false`; a failed mark now means failed-and-not-being-retried. (User
  report: the TUI showed ✗ "2/2 complete" beside a live spinner.)
- Pending operator steering defers program self-completion: a clean program
  with `completion: all-actions-ok` returns to the planner gate (event
  `decision.completion_deferred`), which delivers the steer — instead of
  auto-completing and silently discarding it (defect observed live:
  0 `steering.delivered` events for a queued steer). Steering that can no
  longer reach any gate is marked `expired_undelivered` with event
  `steering.expired` at the terminal transition; interrupted runs keep their
  queue for the resumed run's next gate.
- Resume re-runs an action the interruption cancelled mid-flight instead of
  re-planning around a phantom failure: cancelled actions and the dependents
  blocked only by them are reopened (event `action.reopened`) and the accepted
  program continues from where it stopped. Observed on a SIGTERM-interrupted
  run: 1 cancelled action → 4 "blocked" → a spurious planner turn.
- Planner contract: a verify with several `dependsOn` must set `review`
  (rule 4); the program's last worker must be covered by a successful verify
  (rule 8) — both were the causes of extra planner gates on the goal-3 proof
  run. A corrective turn's `validationFeedback.rejectedResponseExcerpt` is
  capped at 2 000 chars, and the rejected proposal is resent as a skeleton
  (ids, shapes, dependsOn; prompts elided) — the planner's thread already
  holds it verbatim.
- A verify without `review` is no longer grounds to reject a whole program:
  it reviews its single (or last) dependency's artifact, or audits the
  repository directly when it has no `dependsOn` (`reviewScope: repository`).
  Observed on two proof runs: a 9-action program bounced for one field,
  costing a 5-minute correction turn each time.

## 0.14.0 — structured worker output, compact planner contract

- A verify whose reply cannot be parsed as the verdict JSON gets ONE bounded
  re-ask (event `verify.verdict_retry`) before its failure can reach a planner
  boundary — observed on run `ejk9w2`: one unparseable verdict cost a full
  planner turn plus ~8 minutes of re-proving a passing state.
- Planner contract amendments from the same run's observations: a verify is
  scoped to what can be true at its point in the graph (later-scheduled work is
  not a defect; cosmetic mismatches are concerns, never ok:false); when the
  goal's acceptance checks pass the planner returns complete instead of adding
  polish actions; restored the shared-working-tree, redundant-verification,
  and operatorSteering guidance dropped by the contract merge.
- "Full" planner-context excerpts (scout, new-since-last-decision, failing
  verifies) obey the per-excerpt and total budgets again; the compaction must
  never rebuild the 163 k-char contexts it replaced.
- Planner context and contract compacted: complete emitted planner task text up to the durable-context marker, worktree-isolation suffix included **OBSERVED** `16,316 -> 5,208` characters, and a sample turn-2 durable context **COMPUTED** `163,000 -> 23,547` characters by replacing full attempt records with compact ledger rows and retaining full output excerpts only for new/scout or `ok:false` verify actions.
- Planner `run` actions and fan-out `stepTemplate`s may declare an optional
  `outputSchema`, an object-typed JSON-Schema subset. The runtime tells the
  worker to end its output with one matching JSON object, parses and validates
  it, and persists a `run` result as `outputs.<id>.data` with `schemaOk: true`;
  fan-out results store those fields inside each `outputs.<fanoutId>.items[]`
  entry. Successful validation emits `action.output_validated`.
- Schema failures emit `action.output_schema_retry` and receive exactly one
  bounded retry with the validation errors and the previous output tail. If
  that retry also fails, the action remains `ok:false`, records
  `schemaOk:false` and `schemaErrors`, and keeps the output text with the
  reason `output did not match outputSchema: <errors>`. Resumed runs do not
  re-dispatch actions already marked `schemaOk:true`.
- Dependent prompts can render `{{outputs.<id>.data.<field>}}`, and
  `fanout.itemsFrom` accepts `outputs.<id>.data.items` without an extraction
  agent when the array is already present. Planner decision validation rejects
  `outputSchema` on a proposed `verify` because verify has a fixed verdict
  shape.

## 0.13.2 — user text is never a template

- `workflow goal` failed before anything ran when the goal text quoted
  something shaped like a template ref (`{{outputs.x.data.field}}` in a goal
  *about* templates): the goal was spliced into the scout prompt and the
  workflow validator rejected the ref as unresolvable — "autonomous workflow
  invalid (nothing ran)". The goal is now a declared input (`inputs.goal`)
  inserted at render time, so nothing in user text is ever parsed.
- A grammar-valid ref with nothing behind it no longer kills the action at
  render time. It is left literally in the prompt and reported as
  `template.unresolved_ref { actionId, ref }`; planner-authored prompts may
  quote refs as text, and a worker can usually still act on the literal.
  `renderTemplate(str, scope, { strict: true })` keeps the old hard failure.

## 0.13.1 — a repaired verify counts as verification of its repair

- `completionEvidenceGaps` accepted a verify as evidence for the latest worker
  only when the verify depended on that worker. The executor's repair loop
  produces the reverse edge — `<verify>-repair-N` depends on `<verify>`, then
  the same verify re-runs — so after a clean repair round every `complete`
  was rejected with "missing a successful verification of latest worker
  <verify>-repair-1", and 0.13.0's `all-actions-ok` auto-completion would
  have been blocked the same way. Observed on goal-2 run `wf-mtdcghw0`
  (2026-08-28): three extra planner turns and one redundant verify (~11 min)
  to prove what the re-verify had already shown. A verify that ended ok:true
  after its own repair action now verifies that repair.

## 0.13.0 — programs can complete themselves

- A planner may attach `completion: { when: "all-actions-ok", reason }` to a
  program (a `needs_more_work` decision that includes at least one verify).
  When every action of that program — repairs included — finishes ok and the
  completion policy is satisfied, the runtime records the `complete` decision
  itself (`source: "program-completion"`, event `decision.auto_completed`) and
  the run ends without another planner turn. Anything failing emits
  `decision.completion_predicate_unmet` (with the failing action ids) and the
  boundary returns to the planner as before. Measured motivation: in the goal-2
  comparison every clean bullswarm run still paid a final 110–250 s planner
  turn just to say "complete"; Claude's script ends when its code says so.

## 0.12.1 — a burst-gated provider is waited for, never failed on the spot

- `workflow` runs no longer die with `no eligible pool` when every candidate
  pool is burst-gated (provider 5-hour window ≥ 90 % used). The runtime parks
  the dispatch in a new `waiting_for_quota` stage (`state.quotaWait` names the
  pool, its 5h usage and reset time; events `dispatch.waiting_for_quota`,
  `dispatch.quota_available`, `dispatch.quota_wait_expired`), re-reads the
  provider meter every 60 s, and continues the moment the gate lifts. It gives
  up — with the pool, usage and reset time in the failure reason — only after
  the known reset time plus 10 min of grace (5 h when no reset time is known).
  The planner's context is composed after the wait, so it never sees an empty
  pool list. Observed 2026-08-28 19:09 Z: the first 0.12.0 comparison run
  failed in 4 s because the account's Claude 5h window read 91 % (reset
  22:30 Z); Claude Code in the same situation waits on the rate limit.
  Options for embedding callers/tests: `quotaPollMs`, `quotaWaitGraceMs`,
  `quotaWaitUnknownResetMs` on `runWorkflow`; `readMeter` injection.

## 0.12.0 — one decision is a whole program

Completes the convergence on Claude Code's dynamic-workflow mechanics
(`docs/claude-dynamic-workflow-mechanics.md` §1.11 and §4.2): the orchestrator
is positioned as the compiler of the goal into a program the runtime runs to
the end, and it is consulted again only at the program boundary (every action
finished, or the graph blocked).

- Data-driven fan-out in proposals: a planner `fanout` may carry
  `itemsFrom: "outputs.<actionId>.outFile"` instead of inline `items`. The
  producer becomes an implicit `dependsOn` and the runtime resolves the item
  list when the producer finishes, so the planner no longer spends a round trip
  waiting to see how many items discovery found. If the producer's output has
  no parseable JSON array, the runtime runs ONE bounded, read-only extraction
  action (`<fanoutId>-items`, `source: "runtime-extraction"`) over that output
  before failing the fan-out truthfully. Resolved lists above
  `maxItemsPerExpansion` fail the fan-out with the count. Events:
  `action.items_resolved`, `action.items_extraction_requested`,
  `action.items_extracted`.
- Repair policy on verify: `repair: { prompt, maxRounds (1–3), effort? }` on a
  planner `verify`. When the verifier returns `ok:false`, the executor runs a
  fix action (`<verifyId>-repair-<n>`, `source: "repair-policy"`) carrying the
  verifier's concerns verbatim and re-runs the same verify, without a planner
  turn. Dispatch or JSON-parse failures are not repaired. Events:
  `action.repair_started`, `action.reverify_started`, `action.repaired`,
  `action.reverify_rejected`, `action.repair_failed`.
- Fan-out artifact: a fan-out now writes `out-<id>-summary-*.md` (every item's
  verdict plus an output excerpt) and records it as `outputs.<id>.outFile`, so a
  verify can depend on a fan-out directly and `review` is inferred as usual.
- Fix: fan-out outputs stored the success COUNT in `ok`, so a dynamic action
  depending on a fan-out could never become ready ("blocked by failed or
  unresolved dependencies") and a fan-out never counted as a successful worker
  for completion evidence. `ok` is now a boolean and the count moved to
  `succeeded`; `fanoutSucceededCount()` reads pre-0.12 state files.
- Fix: the content gate rejected a worker whose whole answer is a JSON array
  or object as an "announcement without substance", which is exactly what a
  discovery step is told to return. Structured answers now pass
  (`hasStructuredAnswer`).
- `parseJsonArray` prefers the trailing array, so prose containing brackets
  before the list no longer poisons `itemsFrom`.
- Planner prompt: PLANNING DOCTRINE rewritten around "you are compiling the
  goal into a program"; new data-driven fanout and repair skeletons; a
  four-action program skeleton (discover → fanout(itemsFrom) → verify(repair)
  → verify-suite); `executionConstraints.programFeatures` and
  `plannerConsultedOnlyAtProgramBoundary`. The goal orchestrator prompt is
  reframed the same way.
- Literal double braces in prompts no longer kill actions. Only a known root
  followed by dotted identifiers (`{{item}}`, `{{outputs.<id>.outFile}}`,
  `{{inputs.x}}`, `{{runId}}`, `{{wfDir}}`) is a template ref; any other
  `{{…}}` text (a JSDoc type such as `{{maxLength?: number}}`, Mustache, a JS
  object in a template literal) is left exactly as written by the renderer
  and ignored by the validator. Observed in the 0.11.1 comparison run: a
  planner-authored verify prompt containing `{{maxLength?: number}}` failed
  at render time with zero attempts. Relatedly, `verify` no longer
  template-renders the artifact it reviews: only the reviewer instructions
  are a template; the worker's report is appended verbatim.
- Doctrine: an `ok:true` verify is accepted; its concerns are informational.
  The 0.11.1 comparison run spent a whole extra program round (7 actions,
  ~10 min) polishing "non-blocking" nits reported by verifiers that had
  passed, which Claude's fix stage never does.
- Scout before compiling: `workflow goal` now starts with a read-only `scout`
  run action (tree, manifest, test status, units of work with the files each
  owns, shared files, risks; ends with a JSON array of unit names) so the
  orchestrator's first program names real files and commands — the counterpart
  of the inline scouting a Claude Code session does before authoring a
  Workflow script. `--no-scout` skips it. A failed scout is non-fatal: the
  planner still runs and sees `outputs.scout.ok=false` with the reason, and
  the scout never counts as a delivery worker.
- The planner finally sees what workers said: every `outputs.<id>` in the
  durable planner context carries `outputExcerpt` (up to 3 000 chars each,
  36 000 total, newest first) instead of only `ok`/`why`/`outFile`.
- `workflow goal` default `maxItemsPerExpansion` raised 8 → 24 so a
  data-driven fan-out over a medium repository does not fail on the bound.
- Known limitation: `itemsFrom` removes the planner turn, not the stage
  barrier. A verify that depends on a data-driven fan-out waits for all items;
  per-item verify overlap on discovered items would need chained
  `stepTemplate`s (not in this release). For known items keep proposing N fix
  + N verify chains inline, which already overlap under the ready-set
  scheduler.

## 0.11.1 — reliable `--watch` handoff

- `workflow goal --watch` no longer races the detached child: the watcher now
  waits up to 30 s for the run's `state.json` to appear before attaching, and
  `runWorkflowWatch` accepts `waitForRunMs`. The 0.11.0 tag failed to publish
  because this race made the release-gate test fail on the CI runner; 0.11.1
  carries the full 0.11.0 change set below.

## 0.11.0 — plan the whole graph, run it wide

Adopts the driving mechanics of Claude Code's dynamic workflow (documented in
`docs/claude-dynamic-workflow-mechanics.md`) into the autonomous loop.

- Ready-set scheduler: every planner action whose dependencies have succeeded
  starts immediately, and a dependent action starts the moment its own inputs
  finish rather than when the whole round finishes. The global
  `settings.concurrency` limiter caps real parallelism. Verify-B now overlaps
  fix-C exactly like a Claude `pipeline()` stage.
- Planning doctrine: the planner is told to propose the complete dependency
  graph in one decision (per-item fix→verify chains plus one whole-system
  verify), to declare file ownership per action and order same-file edits with
  `dependsOn`, to write self-contained worker prompts, and what a planning round
  trip costs. The goal orchestrator prompt no longer asks for "the smallest
  useful set" of actions. `executionConstraints.concurrency` is exposed.
- `workflow goal` default `--concurrency` is 8 (was 3; max 16).
- The planner prompt's shared-working-tree caution now says what is actually
  unsafe (whole-tree mutation, running the full suite while others edit) and
  states that concurrent workers editing disjoint files is the expected mode;
  the 0.10.9 orchestrator had cited the old wording as its reason not to fan
  out ("Implementation is deliberately NOT fanned out … shared-target mutation
  policy").
- `verify.review` is recovered when a planner puts instructions or a filesystem
  path there: instructions move to `prompt`, the single dependency's artifact is
  inferred, and any `review` that is not `outputs.<actionId>.outFile` is
  rejected at validation (feeding the corrective turn) instead of failing a
  dispatch after a full planning round trip.

## 0.10.9 — planner self-correction and honest silence

- An invalid or non-JSON orchestrator decision no longer fails the run. The
  runtime feeds the exact validator issues, the rejected proposal, and a
  response excerpt back to the same orchestrator thread for bounded corrective
  turns (`settings.maxPlannerCorrections`, default 2, emits
  `decision.correction_requested`), then benches that pool as orchestrator for
  the rest of the run and escalates to one other eligible pool
  (`decision.orchestrator_escalated`), and only then settles on a qualified
  `completed_with_concerns`/`blocked` outcome. The decide action's ledger status
  now agrees with that outcome (`failed_retryable` while correcting,
  `failed_terminal` on exhaustion) instead of reporting `succeeded`.
- The planner prompt now shows complete `run`, `fanout` (`items` +
  `stepTemplate.prompt` with `{{item}}`), and `verify` (`review`) skeletons, so
  the first proposal can match what `decision.js` validates.
- `workflow watch` separates two silences: `quiet` counts durable workflow
  events, and a new `agent output … ago` figure (JSONL `transportQuietForSec`)
  counts raw output from live agents, so a thinking agent and a dead one look
  different on the same heartbeat line.
- Removed the dead thin-leaf help renderer left over from the help unification
  and stopped hard-coding the test count in AGENTS.md.

## 0.10.8 — quieter monitoring and resilient orchestration

- Made `workflow watch` aggregate low-level activity into compact interval
  heartbeats by default, with event/action deltas, quiet duration, prompt
  semantic transitions, terminal result handoff, and `--verbose` drill-down.
- Implemented the documented top-level `run --prompt` form and standardized
  usage errors as exit 2 across run, workflow drafts/runs, and strategy paths.
- Added explicit goal-resume orchestrator pin/unpin behavior and strengthened
  the orchestrator as a control-plane-only decision thread.
- Recognize Claude's exact `Failed to authenticate` response as an auth failure
  and migrate the connector signature additively without replacing local
  connector customization.
- Expanded non-network CLI, health, release, watch, resume, auth, help, and
  documentation coverage. The full suite now contains 271 tests.

## 0.10.7 — clearer orchestration overview

- Replaced the orchestrator trace dump with a summary-first view showing what
  it is doing now, the latest decision and reason, the next action, worker
  progress, and the last three semantic events.
- Added `v` progressive disclosure for provider sessions, checkpoint prompts,
  per-turn usage, full decisions, and artifact paths, keeping audit detail
  available without making it the default human experience.

## 0.10.6 — safe setup and boolean flags

- Marked the deterministic `echo` connector as a test fixture and excluded it
  from automatic setup, routing suggestions, connector readiness, and delegate
  readiness. Existing installations receive a one-time migration that disables
  an accidentally enabled fixture while preserving later explicit choices.
- Interactive setup labels test fixtures and defaults them to disabled;
  `doctor` now requires at least one real enabled delegate instead of treating
  canned fixture output as offload capability.
- Made top-level boolean flags explicit so options such as `--no-caller`,
  `--force`, and `--dry-run` cannot swallow a following positional task.
- Thanks to @kwunlokng for reporting both defect classes and supplying focused
  reproductions in #1, #2, and #3.

## 0.10.4 — durable interactive workflow viewer

- Added `workflow runs result <id> [--json]`, a stable
  `bullswarm.workflow.result.v1` handoff for parent agents. It selects the final
  successful delivery rather than the last orchestrator response, pairs it with
  its dependent verification verdict, and reports progress, step logs, token
  usage, and honest complete-or-partial tool-call counts.
- Goal launches now return and print a four-part operating handoff for agentic
  inspection, low-noise watching, the human TUI, and terminal result retrieval.
- Plain `workflow goal` now launches independently, prints that handoff, and
  returns. The new explicit `--watch` flag follows low-noise progress until the
  terminal state; the human TUI is opened from the printed command.
- `--foreground` retains terminal-owned execution and `--detach` remains an
  explicit backward-compatible spelling of the new default.
- Rebuilt interactive workflow inspection as a responsive Phase → Agent →
  Agent-activity browser: desktop uses two contextual panes while mobile and
  narrow SSH terminals use one full-width level. It includes arrow/Enter/Esc
  navigation, numbered semantic actions, active-agent following, scrolling,
  completed-agent outcomes, total semantic-action counts, terminal agent
  progress, resize handling, safe detach, and confirmed stopping.
- Made the autonomous orchestrator a compact selectable control-plane panel
  stacked above the phase tree. Arrow/Enter or `o` opens its
  durable session, checkpoint decisions, semantic
  activity, usage, prompt, outcomes, and artifacts without counting planner
  turns as phase workers.
- Standardized workflow TUI state marks across orchestrator, phases, agents,
  and semantic activity: `○` pending, animated Braille spinner active, `⧖`
  waiting, `✓` complete, and `✗` failed or interrupted.
- Made `maxExpansionRounds` an advisory convergence target instead of a hard
  failure boundary. Near the target the orchestrator is told to consolidate
  existing evidence and avoid marginal expansion; essential bounded work may
  exceed it and the overage is recorded.
- Added truthful qualified terminal outcomes: planner `stop` now yields
  `completed_with_concerns` with a ready best-effort delivery when useful work
  exists, or `blocked` when it does not. Result envelopes expose `verified`,
  the stopping reason, and unresolved concerns without relabeling failed
  verification as success.
- Made phase and agent status derive from semantic output verdicts, so a
  verifier process that successfully returns `ok:false` is displayed as a
  failed verification rather than a completed check.
- Added persisted `strategy exclude-model` / `include-model` policy. Excluded
  models are removed from strategy recommendations and dispatch assignments;
  connectors pin an allowed same-tier fallback or become ineligible when they
  cannot guarantee the exclusion.
- Let the CLI process drain stdout before exiting, preventing large
  `workflow tui --json` snapshots from being truncated around the platform
  pipe-buffer boundary.
- Expanded `workflow --help` into an operational map for building, observing,
  controlling, and auditing workflows.

## 0.10.3 — contextual help everywhere

- Added side-effect-free `-h` / `--help` handling for the top-level CLI and
  every command and nested subcommand, including workflow drafts, run history,
  approvals, actions, integrations, and strategy policy controls.
- Added a centralized command help tree so contextual help is consistent and
  intercepted before setup, provider discovery, state writes, or destructive
  command execution.

## 0.10.2 — cross-agent skill integration

- Added explicit `bullswarm integrate status|install|remove` support for Codex,
  Claude, and Grok. Installation registers one packaged `bullswarm` skill with
  all selected agents and writes concise marker-delimited global awareness
  rules; removal touches only Bullswarm-managed links and blocks.
- Added recoverable `integrate retire-legacy --yes` migration for the retired
  Claude `offload` skill. Detection is read-only and retirement always moves the
  old skill into `~/.claude/skills-archive/`.
- Added recursion-aware global guidance: a worker with `BULLSWARM_DEPTH` set
  performs its assigned task directly instead of casually spawning another
  swarm.
- Renamed the published agent skill from `bullswarm-setup` to `bullswarm` and
  documented single-task, zero-graph goal, fixed-workflow, observation, and
  integration paths together.
- Corrected README language so agent/time targets are advisory while graph
  expansion limits remain hard safeguards.

## 0.10.1 — initiated-time workflow history search

- Added `workflow runs --since <time> --until <time>` filtering against the
  workflow's initiation timestamp (`startedAt`), with an inclusive lower bound
  and exclusive upper bound.
- Added `--from`/`--to` and `--started-after`/`--started-before` aliases plus
  ISO timestamps, local dates, calendar keywords, and relative durations such
  as `7d`.
- Historical listing now falls back to `report.startedAt` when an older state
  record lacks its initiation timestamp, and JSON output reports the normalized
  range used for the audit.

## 0.10.0 — battle-tested advisory orchestration and agent activity

- Made `maxAgents` and `maxWorkflowSeconds` advisory planning targets instead
  of hard stops. Workflows can exceed them to finish required implementation
  and verification; structural graph-growth limits remain enforced.
- Removed implicit connector and generated-goal wall-clock timeouts. Delegates
  wait for natural completion unless an operator explicitly supplies a timeout,
  requests cancellation, or a definitive auth/quota failure is observed.
- Added compatibility migration for generated 0.9.0 goals carrying Bullswarm's
  former 900-second planner/action timeout defaults.
- Fixed adaptive completion policy, current-action metadata, provider routing
  history, usage aggregation, latest-worker verification, and truthful partial
  token/cost accounting found during the Kipwise battle test.
- Added connector-owned native JSONL event adapters for Codex, Claude, Grok,
  Command Code, and OpenCode. Workflows now retain and display the latest three
  semantic shell/read/edit/write/response actions for every active agent.
- Added conservative stall evidence: ten minutes without transport, parsed
  event, or semantic action activity is labeled `suspected_stalled` but never
  causes an automatic kill.
- Added a low-noise `workflow watch <id>` progress stream with semantic-change
  updates, heartbeats, last-three agent actions, and terminal per-attempt timing.
- Added optional durable `workflow steer <id> --message ...` guidance delivered
  only at the next planning checkpoint, never injected into an active worker.
- Captured runtime model IDs declared in provider event streams for more complete
  model/cost attribution, preserved Grok tool kinds across name-less updates,
  and enabled Claude's supported forwarded-subagent text stream.
- Taught planners to reuse clean full-suite evidence and isolate mutation/pre-fix
  experiments instead of redundantly or concurrently testing a changing tree.
- Expanded the offline suite to 224 tests. Real bounded CLI probes confirmed
  all five provider event formats, and an exact packaged OpenCode watch smoke
  passed argument injection, action normalization, final-output extraction,
  and the content gate together.

## 0.9.0 — resilient dynamic workflow routing

- Added cooperative `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handling, durable `interrupted` states,
  dead/stale owner reconciliation, and clean resume after interruption.
- Added capability-context filtering for model recommendations plus an explicit
  `strategy apply --yes` approval gate and TTL-based automatic refresh.
- Added setup-time worktree policy and strategy-autopilot choices.
- Added per-attempt routing reasons/candidate surplus to durable events, state,
  decision logs, and the printable workflow tree.
- Added top-level `runs` and `--version` aliases, complete `workflow goal`
  budget help, and correct phase/terminal display for completed runs.

## 0.8.0 — autonomous goals, model strategy, and auditable usage

- Added `workflow goal` for bounded observe-plan-execute loops without an
  upfront graph, including planner-owned expansion, completion policy,
  detachment, resume, cancellation, ordered events, and durable action and
  attempt ledgers.
- Added first-class `decide` and adversarial `verify` actions with strict JSON
  contracts, capability-aware routing, bounded retries/escalation, and hard
  expansion/dispatch/time limits.
- Added `strategy refresh/show/set-subscription/assign` to discover models from
  installed CLIs, combine connector-owned dated price/benchmark metadata with
  live quota surplus, and persist high/medium/low effort preferences.
- Added connector-owned model selection plus `--effort` routing for ordinary
  runs and workflow actions. Safety eligibility always overrides preferences.
- Added per-attempt agent/model, standard-read/cache-read/cache-write/output
  token estimates, API-equivalent cost, subscription-normalized quota, and
  honest partial totals when a provider omits model or usage data.
- Added `workflow tui <runId>` as a printable historical phase/action/attempt
  tree in both TTY and non-TTY environments, alongside JSON state/events.
- Expanded the offline suite to 195 tests. A fresh-home real-provider trial
  autonomously fixed and independently verified a failing Node fixture; a
  deliberately undersized dispatch budget also stopped truthfully rather than
  claiming completion.

## 0.7.0 — short run IDs + workflow runs

Workflow runs were opaque (`wf-mtapqmfm-ad9ba7` everywhere) and
there was no way to list or operate on past runs except by
file-system diving. v0.7.0 adds:

- **6-character short IDs** (Crockford-style 32-char alphabet, no
  `0/1/i/l/o` for visual clarity). Every new run gets a `shortId`
  on both `state.json` and `report.json`. The full `wf-...` runId
  stays the durable handle.
- **`bullswarm workflow runs ...`** sub-verb:
  - `runs` (default = ongoing only) — list with a `●`/`○` marker
  - `runs --all` — ongoing + historical
  - `runs --historical` — only historical
  - `runs --name <wf>` — filter by workflow
  - `runs --limit N` — cap result count
  - `runs show <id>` — dump `state.json` + `report.json`. Accepts
    shortId, full runId, or run-dir path.
  - `runs delete <id> --yes` — remove a run directory. Refuses
    ongoing runs without `--force`.
- **Resume by short ID**: `bullswarm workflow run <wf> --resume
  <shortId>` resolves the shortId to the full runId before any
  dispatch. Bogus tokens fail fast, before workflow load.
- **`isOngoing(runDir, state)`** helper: classifies a run as
  ongoing when `state.finishedAt` is unset AND `state.json` was
  modified within the last 90 s. After the 90 s window a run is
  treated as historical even if `finishedAt` was never written
  (e.g. process killed before terminal `persist()`).

### New files

- `src/workflow/short-id.js` — Crockford-style generator, resolver,
  `isOngoing`, `listRuns`
- `src/workflow/runs-cli.js` — `cmdRuns` dispatch
- `tests/workflow-runs.test.js` — 16 new tests

### Tests

- 16 new tests covering shortId generation, resolution, lock-free
  ongoing detection, list filtering, show, delete, and the resume
  pre-flight.
- Full suite is 147 green (131 prior + 16 new), stable across 3
  stress runs.
- Verified end-to-end by `cmd -p --yolo` against a real CLI
  installation: every step of the runbook passed.

## 0.6.0 — incremental workflow drafts (CLI builder)

The static `workflow run <file>` shape required every workflow to be
authored as a JSON file in advance. That's not "dynamic" — it's a script
of record. v0.6.0 introduces `bullswarm workflow draft ...`, a
sub-verb group that lets you build a workflow interactively from the
shell, one mutation at a time. Drafts persist under
`~/.bullswarm/drafts/<name>/` and are promoted to first-class
workflows (discoverable, runnable by name, validatable) the moment
they're created.

### New CLI surface

```
bullswarm workflow draft create <name> [--description ...] [--input k=v]...
bullswarm workflow draft show <name>
bullswarm workflow draft list
bullswarm workflow draft phase add <name> <phase>
bullswarm workflow draft phase remove <name> <phase>
bullswarm workflow draft step add <name> <phase> <step-id> --type run|fanout|verify [--lane ... --prompt ... --add-dir ... --pool ... --items-from ... --review ... --concurrency N --timeout N --on-error ... --step-template <json>]
bullswarm workflow draft step remove <name> <phase> <step-id>
bullswarm workflow draft step set <name> <phase> <step-id> <field> --value <text>
bullswarm workflow draft set <name> <field> --value <text>
bullswarm workflow draft validate <name>
bullswarm workflow draft export <name> <out-file>
bullswarm workflow draft delete <name> --yes
bullswarm workflow draft run <name> [--input k=v]... [--resume id] [--json] [--quiet]
```

- Every mutation re-validates immediately and persists the verdict on
  `meta.json.lastValidation`. `bullswarm workflow list` shows drafts
  with a `(draft)` tag.
- `bullswarm workflow run <draft-name>` and `workflow validate
  <draft-name>` accept a draft name the same way they accept a JSON
  filename — the new `workflowDirs()` entry `~/.bullswarm/drafts/`
  makes drafts first-class.
- `bullswarm workflow draft export <name> <file>` promotes a draft
  to a checked-in JSON for version control.
- Partial drafts (zero phases, or a phase with zero steps) are
  treated as BUILDING, not INVALID — the validator's
  `phases-must-be-non-empty` rule is downgraded to a warning during
  construction. Real schema violations (bad lane, duplicate step id,
  etc.) still return nonzero.
- `delete` requires `--yes` so a stray arrow-key can't nuke a draft.
- The `BULLSWARM_HOME` env var redirects drafts to a sandbox under
  any temp dir, so the same `autoSetup` flow agents use elsewhere
  works here.

### Tests

- 25 new tests in `tests/workflow-draft.test.js`. Two layers:
  module-level (no spawn) for every mutation, CLI-level (spawnSync)
  for the user-facing contract.
- Full suite is now 131 green (106 prior + 25 new).

### Files

- New: `src/workflow/draft.js` — storage, atomic writes, validation hook
- New: `src/workflow/draft-cli.js` — `cmdDraft` dispatch + flag parsing
- New: `tests/workflow-draft.test.js`
- Modified: `src/workflow/cli.js` (added `draft` sub-verb, drafts in
  `workflowDirs()` and `discover()`)

## 0.5.0 — gap-closure release

Workflow parity with Claude Code dynamic workflows plus deep-QA hardening.
All 10 gaps identified in the v0.4.0 audit are closed; 23 new tests
added; full suite is 105 green (82 prior + 23 new).

### Workflow runtime (R-numbered doctrine)

- **R4 — global concurrency limiter**: a real `Semaphore` (`src/workflow/semaphore.js`) is shared by every `runSingle` and every fanout worker. Per-fanout worker count is capped at `min(per-fanout, limiter.permits, items.length)`. A `step.blocked` event fires when items queue behind the cap.
- **R6 — recursion-guard propagation**: every workflow dispatch computes `childDepthEnv(parentEnv)` and passes it to `watchOnce`. The runtime asserts `assertDepthAllowed(coreState, parentEnv)` before each dispatch. A workflow that itself spawns `bullswarm` is refused at the core's depth limit instead of recursing forever. `src/lib/watch.js` now honors caller-supplied `opts.env` so the depth env actually reaches the child.
- **R7 — quarantine + decision log on workflow auth failures**: when a dispatch inside a workflow returns `quarantineHint: true`, the runtime calls `quarantinePool(state, poolName, why, now)` against the core state file and appends a `source: "workflow"` entry to the shared `decisionLog` so `bullswarm health` and `pools` see workflow runs. The live `pools` view is updated so the next dispatch in the same run does not re-select the benched pool.
- **R8 — burst-gate exclusion in workflows**: `preparePools` now drops any pool with `burstGate === true` (5h ≥ 90 %), matching the single-run path.
- **R10 — fingerprint-aligned fanout resume**: every fanout result is now stamped with `sha1(JSON.stringify(item)).slice(0,12)`. On resume, items are matched by fingerprint first; positional alignment is a fallback for state.json from prior versions. Reordering, adding, or removing items no longer breaks resume.
- **R9 — outputText truncation**: `recordOutput` caps `state.outputs[id].outputText` at `OUTPUT_TEXT_CAP_BYTES = 64 KB`. The on-disk outFile always holds the full transcript. Persisted state.json is now bounded.

### New step type: `verify` (skeptic)

- Adversarial review of a prior step. Schema: `{ type: "verify", review: "outputs.<prior>.outFile", lane, prompt?, timeoutSec? }`. The runtime reads the prior outFile, inlines it into a structured prompt asking for `RETURN ONLY {"ok": <bool>, "concerns": [...], "summary": ...}`, dispatches through the standard pool-routed pipeline, and parses the first JSON object in the response. Step is `ok:true` only if dispatch verifies AND the JSON `ok` is `true`. The parsed `verify` object is recorded on `state.outputs[id].verify` so downstream steps can reference `concerns` and `summary`.
- Validated: `review` must resolve to a known prior outFile or a declared input; `inputs.<k>.required` is now type-checked and runtime-enforced.
- See `workflows/verify-and-cap.json` for an end-to-end example.

### New settings

- `settings.maxAgents` — hard cap; a step that would push dispatch count past the cap fails with `why: "spend guard: maxAgents=... reached"`.
- `settings.warnAtAgents` — advisory; a `workflow.large` event fires once when the threshold is crossed. TUI renders it as `⚠ Large workflow: N dispatches ≥ threshold M`.
- `settings.concurrency` is now validated to be `≤ 16`, matching Claude Code's runtime cap.
- `inputs.<k>.required: true` is now a hard pre-flight refusal. `runWorkflow` throws `required input "<k>" missing` before any dispatch.

### New runtime events

- `item.skipped` — emitted by fanout resume; was dropped silently in TTY mode. Now rendered as `⏭ <stepId>[i]   ok from previous run (resume)`.
- `step.blocked` — emitted when items queue behind the global cap; rendered as `⋈ N item(s) queued behind concurrency cap in <stepId>`.
- `workflow.large` — emitted once when the dispatch threshold is crossed.

### CLI

- `BULLSWARM_HOME` env var now overrides the workflow CLI's `BULLSWARM_DIR` (previously hardcoded to `~/.bullswarm`). Matches the meter registry.
- `--input k=v` accepts JSON-encoded values so arrays and objects can be passed: `--input 'items=["a","b"]'`. The legacy string form is unchanged.

### TUI

- `item.skipped`, `step.blocked`, and `workflow.large` are all rendered in human mode (previously `item.skipped` was TTY-invisible).

### Tests

- 23 new tests in `tests/workflow-gaps.test.js`, one per gap closure.
- 105 total tests, all green, no network, ~1 s.
